# ROS 2 Snapshot Tools


### Description

Within this repository are Python-based [ROS 2](http://www.ros.org) tools that
can be used to capture a software model of a ROS 2 Workspace and running ROS deployment.

The captured model can be loaded, manipulated, and exported for documentation or use
in so-called Model Integrated Computing (MIC) or Model Driven Engineering (MDE).

This repository includes the following modules:
* `core`                    - ROS Entity metamodel classes and tools for
                               marshalling/unmarshalling instances of these
                               metamodels (model)
* `workspace_modeler`       - a tool to capture specification model of existing ROS
                               workspace
* `snapshot`                - a tool to capture models from currently running ROS
                               deployments

The system is useful for Interface Control Documentation (ICD) of deployed systems.

### Initial Setup

The Python 3 executables require `graphviz`, `pydantic`, `pytest`, and `PyYAML` packages. Use
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

### Source Build

Clone this project into your [Colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/installation.html) Workspace, and run the following commands:
- `colcon build`
- `source <ros_ws_location>/setup.bash` (your `.bashrc` may handle this automatically on shell restart)

Thereafter, `ros2_snapshot` is available for use.

To capture a model of the ROS 2 workspace, including installed and custom packages, as configured on your machine:
```
ros2 run ros2_snapshot workspace
```

To capture a model of currently running system:
```
ros2 run ros2_snapshot running
```

By default, the snapshot tools save information in `yaml` and `pickle` formats
in the default `~/.snapshot_modeling` folder. Additionally, `json` and human readable basic
text formats, along with a graphviz based DOT view of the ROS computation graph,
are available as options.

Use the `-a` option to save all available formats.

See the READMEs in each module for more information, or `-h` to see options.

### Basic Demonstration

To see a basic demonstration, first run the workspace modeler

`clear; ros2 run ros2_snapshot workspace -a`

And inspect the specification files in the default `~/.snapshot_modeling` folder.

Then, run some ROS nodes

`clear; ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node --ros-args -r __ns:=/demo`

`clear; ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key --ros-args -r __ns:=/demo`

`clear; ros2 run demo_nodes_py talker`

`clear; ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener`

And run the snapshot tool

`clear; ros2 run ros2_snapshot running -a`

Again inspect the data bank files in the default `~/.snapshot_modeling` folder.
